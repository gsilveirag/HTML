<h3>Available Spaceships</h3>

<h4>Falcon 9</h4>
<img src="/estilo/src/falcon_9.jpg" alt="">
<p>Falcon 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceX for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the world’s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access.</p>

<h4>Falcon Heavy</h4>
<img src="/estilo/src/falcon_heavy.jpg" alt="">
<p>Falcon Heavy is composed of three reusable Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. As one of the world’s most powerful operational rockets, Falcon Heavy can lift nearly 64 metric tons (141,000 lbs) to orbit.</p>
